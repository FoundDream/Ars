# Details that make interfaces feel better

Great interfaces rarely come from a single thing. It's usually a collection of small details that compound into a great experience. Apply these principles when building or reviewing UI code.

When reviewing, slow the interface down: replay motion at 10% speed in the browser's Animations panel and walk every state: hover, focus, active, loading, empty. What feels off at 10% speed is what's subtly wrong at full speed.

Preserve the project's component library, tokens, density, and motion language. Treat the numeric recipes below as a coherent house-style starting point only when the project has no established answer; they are not accessibility requirements or universal design laws.

Typography (text wrapping, font rendering, tabular numbers, spacing) is covered by the Typography domain; use that for anything text-related. Accessibility (hit areas, focus states, keyboard support, ARIA, reduced motion) is covered by the Accessibility domain. Layout structure (grouping, spacing between sections, breakpoints, spatial RTL) is covered by the Layout domain.

## Quick Reference

| Category | When to Use |
| --- | --- |
| [Surfaces](ui-surfaces.md) | Border radius, optical alignment, shadows, image outlines |
| [Animations](ui-animations.md) | Interruptible animations, enter/exit transitions, icon animations, scale on press, motion restraint |
| [Icons](ui-icons.md) | Icon stroke weight, states via `currentColor`, outline vs fill, sizing, RTL flipping |
| [Performance](ui-performance.md) | Transition specificity, `will-change` usage |

## Core Principles

### 1. Concentric Border Radius

For closely nested, evenly inset surfaces, start with outer radius = inner radius + padding. Preserve established component tokens or choose independently when the surfaces are not visually concentric.

### 2. Optical Over Geometric Alignment

When geometric centering looks off, align optically. Buttons with icons, play triangles, and asymmetric icons all need manual adjustment.

### 3. Shadows for Elevation, Borders for Structure

For buttons, cards, and containers whose border exists only to create depth, prefer layered transparent `box-shadow` values. Keep borders that communicate structure or state: dividers, layout separators, and selected or focus states.

### 4. Interruptible Animations

Use CSS transitions for interactive state changes: they can be interrupted mid-animation. Reserve keyframes for staged sequences that run once.

### 5. Split and Stagger Enter Animations

For an infrequent staged entrance where sequence helps communicate hierarchy, break content into semantic chunks and stagger them by ~100ms instead of animating one container. Do not stagger routine, high-frequency interactions.

### 6. Subtle Exit Animations

Use a small fixed `translateY` instead of full height. Exits should be softer than enters. Use `ease-out` for both enter and exit transitions.

### 7. Contextual Icon Animations

Animate contextual icon swaps with `opacity`, `scale`, and optional blur when motion improves state continuity. If no project recipe exists, start with scale from `0.25` to `1`, opacity from `0` to `1`, blur from `4px` to `0px`, and no bounce. Match an installed `motion` or `framer-motion` package; otherwise keep both icons in the DOM and cross-fade with CSS. Honor reduced motion in every implementation.

### 8. Image Outlines

When images need separation from nearby surfaces, consider a subtle inset `1px` neutral outline. If the project has no outline token, pure black at low opacity in light mode and pure white at low opacity in dark mode are safe starting points. Skip the outline when the image treatment or established system does not need it.

### 9. Scale on Press

A subtle press scale can add tactile feedback when it matches the interaction language. If no project value exists, start near `0.96` and avoid exaggerated scaling below `0.95`. Provide a static path and honor reduced motion.

### 10. Skip Animation on Page Load

Use `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence` to prevent enter animations on first render. Verify it doesn't break intentional entrance animations.

### 11. Never Use `transition: all`

Always specify exact properties: `transition-property: scale, opacity`. Tailwind's `transition-transform` covers `transform, translate, scale, rotate`.

### 12. Use `will-change` Sparingly

Only for `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`, the properties the GPU can composite. Never use `will-change: all`. Only add when you notice first-frame stutter.

### 13. Match Icon Stroke to Text Weight

Match an icon's optical weight to adjacent text while preserving the icon set's native conventions. Values around `1.5px` beside regular text and `2px` beside semibold text on a 24px grid are useful starting points, not automatic overrides.

### 14. One SVG, Recolored per State

Icons use `currentColor` and get their states (hover, selected, disabled) from CSS color and opacity, never from separate assets. Outline variant is the default; fill variant marks the active state.

### 15. Motion Restraint

No custom animation on high-frequency interactions: the attention cost repeats on every trigger. Motion is never the only feedback channel; every animated state change also needs a static cue (color, icon, label).

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Same border radius on closely nested parent and child | Calculate `outerRadius = innerRadius + padding` |
| Icons look off-center | Adjust optically with padding or fix SVG directly |
| Border used only to fake elevation | Use layered `box-shadow` with transparency; keep structural and state borders |
| Jarring staged entrance or contextual exit | Stagger infrequent entrances and keep context-preserving exits subtle |
| Stateful icon or toggle animates its default state on page load | Add `initial={false}` to that `AnimatePresence`; preserve intentional page entrances |
| `transition: all` on elements | Specify exact properties |
| First-frame animation stutter | Add `will-change: transform` (sparingly) |
| Hairline icon beside bold text | Match the stroke width to the text weight |
| Separate icon assets per state | One `currentColor` SVG, states via CSS |
| Filled icons everywhere | Outline as default, fill only for the active state |
| Entrance animation on every hover or keystroke | Instant feedback or ≤150ms opacity/color transition |
